# facial-expression
The Faces have been automatically registered so that the face is centered and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)
